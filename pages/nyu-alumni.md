**Chinmay Nanda, M.Sc.**  
_Graduated: January 2014._  
  
_MS Thesis Topic:_ Design of a low-power EEG monitoring Device  
  
_Research summary:_  
This project aims at developing a low-power and low-noise EEG data acquisition system, with a thesis focus on development of analog front-end and power supply for the device. Chinmay also works on other aspects of the hardware design such as selection of digital and RF components, and works with the software and the algorithm development team.

**Max Lei, M.Sc.**  
_Graduated: January 2014._  
  
_MS Thesis Topic:_ ADC Optimization for Implantable Devices  
  
_Research summary:_  
We investigate circuit optimization techniques to reduce the area and power of SAR ADCs. We also investigate architecture level power-optimizations to optimize the power consumption of the SAR ADCs in implantable extracellular recording devices.

**Zhendong 'Eric' Xu, M.Sc.**  
_Graduated: May 2014._  
  
_MS Thesis Topic:_ Low-power Amplifier Arrays  
  
_Research summary:_  
There is a clear need on increasing the number of channels on implantable devices to improve their functionality and accuracy. However, this need should be carefully balanced against the power limitations of these devices. In this thesis, we are exploring design trade-offs for amplifier arrays to provide better scalability.
