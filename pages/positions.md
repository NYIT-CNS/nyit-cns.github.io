## Fully funded Ph.D. position available for Spring/Fall 2024!

Fully funded Ph.D. position available for Spring/Fall 2024 at New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) New York City Campus in ASIC/FPGA Design of ML/DL Accelerators!  
  
I am looking for a highly motivated, hard-working candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering who will be working with an interdisciplinary team of electrical and computer engineers, biomedical engineers, and computer scientists. The position is part of a cluster hire of Ph.D. students in various fields.  
  
The ideal candidate will have a strong background in digital design and be familiar with FPGA and ASIC design flows. Familiarity with machine/deep learning accelerators, low-power architectures, neuromorphic computing, approximate computing, emerging memory, and/or processing-in-memory is highly desirable but not required.  
  
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills and excellent written and verbal communication skills are also required.  
  
An MS degree in Electrical Engineering/Computer Engineering or a related field is desired. However, exceptional candidates with a BS degree or relevant work experience will also be considered.  
  
You will work on algorithm/architecture design, hardware implementation (FPGA and custom), and field testing of accelerators for biomedical and power applications.  
  
NYIT is located in New York City across Central Park between Central Park and Lincoln Center.  
  
If interested, please e-mail your CV (including test scores) and (unofficial) transcript(s) to [nartan@nyit.edu](mailto:nartan@nyit.edu) with the subject line “[ASIC Ph.D. Candidate] YOUR NAME”.
