### Fully funded Ph.D. position available for Fall 2024!

**Ph.D. Position in ASIC/FPGA Design of ML/DL Accelerators:** The ideal candidate will have a strong background in VLSI, FPGAs, and computer architecture specifically for machine/deep learning accelerators. Familiarity with low-power architectures, neuromorphic computing, approximate computing, emerging memory, and/or processing-in-memory is highly desirable but not required. Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, along with excellent written and verbal communication skills, are also required. An MS degree in Electrical Engineering/Computer Engineering or a related field is desired. However, exceptional candidates with a BS degree or relevant work experience will also be considered. You will work on algorithm/architecture design as well as hardware implementation and field-testing of accelerators for biomedical and power applications.

If interested, please e-mail your CV (including test scores) and (unofficial) transcript(s) at nartan@nyit.edu with the subject line "[ASIC Ph.D. Candidate] YOUR NAME".
