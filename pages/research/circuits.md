For medical implantable electronic devices, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are ubiquitous. Although, implantable device design is governed by many tight constraints, most of the ADCs for these devices are generic and do not take advantage of the underlying application of the device. In this project, we aim to explore system level properties of the signal sampled (such as the significance of a sample) to design application-specific ADCs.
