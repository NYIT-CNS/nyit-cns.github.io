Next generation routers should support 100-400 Gbps worst-case IPv4 and IPv6 lookup throughput, fast incremental route update capability, large routing tables, and low power consumption at a low cost. The goal of this project is to design and implement efficient hash-based data structures to allow cost-effective DRAM-only, and high-speed route lookup data structures that will not limit the use of the full parallel processing power of the FPGAs.
