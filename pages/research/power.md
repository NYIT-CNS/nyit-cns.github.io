# High-efficiency and space-efficient transcutaneous power transfer with multi-layer coils

![](/assets/images/research/coils.jpg)  
  
TETS (Transcutaneous Energy Transfer System) has been successfully used for powering medical implants. However, their low power transfer efficiencies limit their scalability to high power levels. The power lost due to low efficiency heats the tissue, and can cause unacceptable increase in skin temperature leading to tissue death. The efficiency can be improved by increasing the coil diameters. Though, this is rarely practical due to space limitations.  
This project aims to improve the efficiency of such systems without increasing the area of coils but instead using multi-layer coils, where each layer can be designed independently to maximize performance.  
Our experiments show a 5x increase in the duration of safe power delivery (not increasing the skin temperature more than 2 C) using multi-layer coils as the secondary coil compared to using single-layer coils even when there is a 50% misalignment in between primary and secondary coils.

In this project, we are developing new power circuit architectures and designing new power chips for TETS (Transcutaneous Energy Transfer System) to maximize efficiency for both wireless power supplies, and transcutaneous battery chargers.
